# My YouTube Playlist

An AngularJS project that consumes data from a YouTube API JSON feed to produce a single-page app that lists YouTube videos in a playlist.

## Resources
* [YouTube API JSON feed](https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlistItems?part=snippet,contentDetails,status&maxResults=10&playlistId=PLSi28iDfECJPJYFA4wjlF5KUucFvc0qbQ&key=AIzaSyCuv_16onZRx3qHDStC-FUp__A6si-fStw)
* [Wireframes](http://m5sdq6.axshare.com/)

## Guidelines
* The site should be built using responsive techniques to behave well on a variety of devices
* Look and feel is up to you
* The website should function as a onepage
app
* Layout should match the provided wireframes
